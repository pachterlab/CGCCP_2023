This repository contains the scripts and notebooks for the preprint "Mechanistic generative models for multimodal single-cell RNA sequencing data". Although autoencoder models can be treated as purely phenomenological and descriptive, without any explicit claims about the process physics, it is possible to exploit *implicit* physics encoded in the mathematical formulation to encode physics. By interpreting the _scVI_ model as a description of a particular noise model, we can represent bivariate RNA distributions. We benchmark the implementation, _biVI_, on simulated and biological data.

`code/` contains all of the scripts used to implement _biVI_, as well as all of the notebooks used to generate the manuscript figures. `Demo.ipynb` is a short Google Colaboratory notebook that demonstrates _biVI_ and two _scVI_ configurations using a small human blood cell dataset.
