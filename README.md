This repository contains the scripts and notebooks for the preprint "Biophysical modeling with variational autoencoders for bimodal, single-cell RNA sequencing data". Although variational autoencoders can be treated as purely phenomenological and descriptive, without any explicit claims about the process physics, it is possible to exploit *implicit* physics encoded in the mathematical formulation to encode physics. By interpreting the _scVI_ model as a description of a particular noise model, we can represent bivariate RNA distributions. We benchmark the implementation, _biVI_, on simulated and biological data.

`BIVI/` contains all of the scripts used to implement _biVI_, while `Manuscript/analysis/` contains all of the notebooks and scripts used to generate the manuscript figures and results. `Example/` contains a `kb_pipeline.sh,` a script that demonstrates how to align raw reads to a reference genome to obtain the unspliced/spliced count matrices necessary for _biVI_, and 'Demo.ipynb,` a Google Colaboratory notebook that processes the output matrices, train a _biVI_ model, and visualize the results.
